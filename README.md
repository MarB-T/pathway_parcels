	Pathway Parcels
This is an app that is going to give persons travelling the option to be "delivery/courrier providers" for goods to be delivered to their travel destination for a fee.
The app (initially only web and mobile to  be included later) is first going to be developed using python flask framework, MYSQL database and html, css $ javascript. It is will also part of my portfolio project under the ALX-SE program.
